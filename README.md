# Banking-domain-data-analyics
This end-to-end project analyzes banking data using Python, MySQL, and Power BI to uncover insights about loans, deposits, and customer profiles. The data is cleaned and processed in Python, stored in MySQL, and visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard that displays key metrics like total clients, total loans, deposits, and feesâ€”making complex banking data easy to understand at a glance.
